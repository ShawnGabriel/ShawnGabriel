# Hey fellow enthusiasts!

My name is Shawn Intong, I'm an undergraduate student based in Vancouver, Canada 🍁🇨🇦

I am taking Geophysics with Data Science as a Minor at the University of British Columbia. I'm planning to pivot into the AI/ML space, as I'm deeply interested behind the magic of mathematics and statistics. You will find my various projects hosted here!
